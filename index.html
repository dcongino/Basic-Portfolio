            <section id="main-bio">My name is Drew (I go by my middle name).  I'm 38 years old, and I am the proud father of a beautiful little
                girl named Celia.  I live in Heber City, UT where I was born and raised.  I have a bachelor's degree from 
                the University of Utah in Kinesiology, and I now work as a bar manager for Red Rock Brewing Co.

                In my spare time, I enjoy music study and I play the guitar.  I also enjoy competitive distance running and daily fantasy sports.
                I am hoping to make a substantive shift in career trajectory through enrollment in this coding program, and I am optimistic
                that will be the case.
